**[View Live Project Details](https://sureshpun.github.io/portfolio/projects/car-viewer.html)**

This Go-based web application is designed as a **Car Viewer**, allowing users to browse and explore a wide range of cars, from sleek sports models to family-friendly rides. Users can filter cars based on various criteria, compare specifications, and find detailed information about each model. The application fetches car data from an external API and dynamically displays it via a web interface. The app leverages Go's concurrency model to efficiently handle API requests and manage data.

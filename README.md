### 📂 Projects
This project is fully functional, but the code is not publicly available at this time due to school regulations. It will be made public once course restrictions are lifted.

You can still view the interface and demo here by clicking pictures below:

#### 🎭 Art Decoder Encoder Interface
Welcome to the Art Encoding and Decoding Web Application! This web-based application, built with **Go (Golang)**, allows you to encode and decode ASCII art using custom encoding logic. It's a fun tool for encoding art into a special format or decoding it back to its original form.

🛠️ Tools Used
Go (Golang): The primary programming language for this project.
HTML/CSS: For building and styling the user interface.
HTTP & Web Templates: To render dynamic content on the web page.

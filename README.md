### 🎭 Art Decoder Encoder Interface
Welcome to the Art Encoding and Decoding Web Application! This web-based application, built with **Go (Golang)**, allows you to encode and decode ASCII art using custom encoding logic. It's a fun tool for encoding art into a special format or decoding it back to its original form.

Click on the image below to see more about the Art Decoder interface in action:
Check out the YouTube video for a full demo of the interface and its features.
